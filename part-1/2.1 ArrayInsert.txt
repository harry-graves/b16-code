2 Arrays
2.1 Complexity of ArrayInsert

What is the big O complexity of ArrayInsert?

In the worst case, the element is to be inserted at the front of the array.
ArrayInsert then has to increase the length of the array by 1,
iterate through all n elements moving them back 1 place, and then inserting
the new element at the front. Therefore, the time complexity of ArrayInsert
is O(n)

2.2 Writing ArrayDelete

The function ArrayDelete has been implemented in the file array_delete.hpp
and tested using the driver arry_delete_driver.cpp
